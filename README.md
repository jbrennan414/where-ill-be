# About
Ever go skiing, and later in the day, you're watching Instagram stories, and see that some of your friends were at the same resort? Well, same. You could have carpooled, you could have gotten lunch together! Well, whereIllBe puts an end to that problem!

# Setup 
This project utilizes node and npm. In order to get started, clone, `npm install` and `npm start`. However, you won't be able to get very far without API keys. Let me know if you'd like to be a collaborator, and I can get you started!
